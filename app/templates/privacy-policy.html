                <h4><strong>2. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></h4>

                <h4><strong>3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</strong></h4>
                
                <p><strong>Briefly: </strong>We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</p>            
                
                <p>We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consent: </strong>We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests: </strong>We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.</li>

                    <li><strong>Legal Obligations: </strong>We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</li>
                    <li><strong>Vital Interests: </strong>We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:</p>

                    <li><strong>Business Transfers. </strong>We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4><strong>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></h4>
                
                <p><strong>Briefly: </strong>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>            
                
                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 7 days past the termination of the user's account.</p>
                
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></h4>
                
                <p><strong>Briefly: </strong>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</p>            
                
                <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Apps is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong></h4>

                <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Apps, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Apps.

If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at info@fraktus.app.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></h4>
                
                <p><strong>Briefly: </strong>In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may terminate your account at any time.</p>            
                
                <p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
                
                <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal.</p>
                
                <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.</a></p>
                
                <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
                
                <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Log into your account settings and delete your account.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, some information my be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Opting out of email marketing: </strong>You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we will still need to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account. To otherwise opt-out, you may:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4><strong>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></h4>
                
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></h4>
                
                <p><strong>Briefly: </strong>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</p>            
                
                <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
                
                <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Apps, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Apps. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Apps, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</strong></h4>
                
                <p><strong>Briefly: </strong>Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>
